Sure! Here's a Python problem for you:

**Problem: Anagram Checker**

Write a Python function that checks if two given strings are anagrams of each other. Two strings are anagrams if they contain the same characters with the same frequency, but possibly in a different order.

**Function Signature:**
```python
def are_anagrams(str1: str, str2: str) -> bool:
    pass
```

**Example:**
```python
print(are_anagrams("listen", "silent"))  # Output: True
print(are_anagrams("triangle", "integral"))  # Output: True
print(are_anagrams("apple", "pale"))  # Output: False
```

**Requirements:**
1. The function should be case-insensitive.
2. Ignore spaces while checking for anagrams.

**Hints:**
- You might find the `collections.Counter` class helpful for counting character frequencies.
- Consider converting both strings to lowercase and removing any spaces before comparing them.

Good luck!
